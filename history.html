                The first official World Cup was played in Uruguay 1930, and since then the tournament has been held every fourth year (with exceptions for interruption due to the Second World War).
                It is likely the most popular sporting event in the world, drawing billions of television viewers every tournament.
                Unlike Olympic football, World Cup teams are not limited to players of a certain age or amateur status, so the competition serves more nearly as a contest between the world’s best players. 
                The trophy cup awarded from 1930 to 1970 was the Jules Rimet Trophy, named for the Frenchman who proposed the tournament.
